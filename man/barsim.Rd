)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{A numeric vector with observations of the threshold/control variable}

\item{d}{The delay parameter}

\item{r}{A vector of length 2 containing the trhesholds}

\item{phi}{A vector containing the autoregressive coefficients of regime 0.
Note that a constant/intercept must be specified. If you don't want a
constant, you can just set it to zero.}

\item{psi}{A vector containing the autoregressive coefficients of regime 0}

\item{resvar}{A vector containing the residual variances of regime 0 and 1}

\item{init_vals}{Initial values: The first length(z)-max(p0, p1, d) values
are fixed in the model.}

\item{start_regime}{A starting regime, 0 or 1}
}
\value{
Simulated time series generated by the BAR model
